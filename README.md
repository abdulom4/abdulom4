- Hi, I’m Abdullahi Omar
- I want to learn more about coding while also getting to learn more about our solar system.
- I'm currently undergraduate in computer information science so learning more coding languages will help me.
- I have little knowledge of Python mainly because I haven't used it in a long time and I'm also currently learning Java.
- I don't know a lot about astronomy aside from the basics of how the solar system works.
